CIS 106 W02 Classwork
My name is Anthony (Tony) Esposito and I am taking this class because I want to learn more about computer science. I currently work doing digital marketing and a little bit of web development and I would liek to get better. I am using JavaScript since I understand it already and will likely use it more often.
