# Anthony Esposito

CIS 106 W02 Classwork

## Assignment 1

My name is Anthony (Tony) Esposito and I am taking this class because I want to learn more about computer science. I currently work doing digital marketing and a little bit of web development and I would like to get better at the development side. I am using JavaScript since I understand it already and will likely use it more often.
